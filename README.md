# shrimp
the brain damaged unomptimized shittily written python-based text editor

do you like to be different from everyone else at the expense of your own productivity?
do you have a superiority complex but are in fact very much inferior?
will you try anything once? 

then shrimp is for you!

if you've used vim, youll feel right at home, except you wont because i changed all the fucking keybinds.
start with o --> h to open up the help menu once youre in a new file.
