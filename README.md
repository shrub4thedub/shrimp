# shrimp
the brain damaged unomptimized shittily written python-based text editor

do you like to be different from everyone else at the expense of your own productivity?
do you have a superiority complex but are in fact very much inferior?
do you struggle evey day to use vim but still want to flex on your nonexistent friends that you use a modal text editor?
do you enjoy using thouroughly unfinished and poorly written software?
will you try anything once? 

then shrimp is for you!

if you've used vim, youll feel right at home, except you wont because i changed all the fucking keybinds.
start with o --> h to open up the help menu once youre in a new file.

i barely know how to code please dont attack me and instead give me freindly advice on how to improve this project thanks
